        <h2>How it began...</h2>
        <p><br>
            The rubber duck first emerged from rubber manufacturing in the late 19th century. The earliest rubber ducks were made from vulcanized rubber as that was what they had to work with at the time. As such, they could not float like the ones today.
            <br><br>
            In the 1940's, Sculptor Peter Ganine created a sculpture of a duck. It was then patented and reproduced as a floating toy. As it is now, currently over 50 million have been sold.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Where we are now!</h2>
        <p><br>
            Rubber ducks are now collected by enthusiasts the world over. The 2011 Guinness World Record for World's Largest Rubber Duck Collection had 5,631 different rubber ducks. In 2013, the rubber duck was even inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in a museum in Rochester, New York, along with the game of chess.<br><br>

        <h2>Where we go from here?</h2>
        <p><br>
            The future is unknown! Even now, there are amazing sights such as the video below:<br><br>

            Can you imagine a 6 story tall rubber duck weighing about 30,000 pounds? As the video stated, its name is Mama Duck. If this amazing piece of art can be crafted, one day a floating duck in space will peer down on us with its beaming smile. Though, I suppose we'd have to worry about it breaking and then crashing into Earth.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            There may be a time, one day, when rubber ducks will rule the world... in our imaginations if it hasn't already.<br><br>
